- 👋 Hi, I’m @KoveKim. You can call me Khristian or Kove.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, programming, and much more. I can't fit everything in this little repository.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. I'm building up my fundamentals so that I can create my first project which will be a simple game like tic-tac-toe or snake.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all sorts of projects. I'm trying to learn as much as I can.
- 📫 You can contact me through social media. If you want to know more about me, head over to my Instagram page, @kove.kim
