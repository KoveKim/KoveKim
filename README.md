- 👋 Hi, I’m @KoveKim. You can call me Khristian or Kove. I'm a student from Las Vegas learning computer programming so that I can become a software developer. I graduated high school from Southwest CTA with a concentration in video game design. Since then, I've worked on many different passions trying to find what I want the most and gaining experience along the way.
- 👀 I’m interested in software development. I want to work on projects and see the results of my contributions! I hope I can one day see my name in the credits section of a program.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. I'm building up my fundamentals so that I can create my first project which will be a simple game like tic-tac-toe or snake.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all sorts of projects. I'm trying to learn as much as I can and build up my portfolio.
- 📫 You can contact me through social media. If you want to know more about me, head over to my Instagram page, @kove.kim - I would rather not disclose my personal information other than my name.
