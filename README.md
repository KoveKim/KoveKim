- 👋 Hi, I’m @KoveKim. You can call me Khristian or Kove. I'm a student from Las Vegas learning computer programming so that I can become a software developer. I graduated high school from Southwest CTA with a concentration in video game design. Since then, I've worked on many different passions trying to find what I want the most and gaining experience along the way.
- 👀 I’m interested in software development. I want to work on projects and see the results of my contributions! I hope I can one day see my name in the credits section of a program.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. I'm building up my fundamentals so that I can create my first project which will be a simple game like tic-tac-toe or snake.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all sorts of projects. I'm trying to learn as much as I can and build up my portfolio.
- 📫 You can contact me through social media. If you want to know more about me, head over to my Instagram page, @kove.kim - I would rather not disclose my personal information other than my name.
- My highlighted project: https://github.com/KoveKim/Python-Beginner-Projects/blob/8becd8fa52b95e8a425311c5bb67d33525c29d76/ConvertDecimalToBinary.py

Here is one of my first projects that I made in Python that I'm very proud of. It is a simple decimal-to-binary number converter. The program will prompt the user to enter a decimal number, and then will convert it into binary and output that value. The reason I am proud of this project in particular is because it was one of the first projects that I made where I felt I had actually overcame a challenging issue.

The issue I was facing with this particular project was figuring out the logic needed to perform the desired outcome. Since I am learning how to program, I am also trying to learn different algorithms from scratch without looking up the answers. So this code is all a direct look into how my brain works and how I rationalized the logic.

Basically, all I knew about decimal to binary is that it is the sequence of remainders that are obtained from the quotient of the decimal number and its subsequent quotients. So I hatched the idea to divide the user's decimal input by 2, and then append the remainder of the quotient (through the mod operator) to a list. Then, I made the program output the list in reverse order to obtain the correct binary number. After much trial and error, I finally made a piece of code that did this function correctly every time with any decimal number. It was the program that made me feel confident in my ability to program whatever I needed based on my knowledge.
